In this lab we will create a module and use it from another module.

How to run?

Please open the entire lab directory (not a specific file inside)
under the current lab directory using IntelliJ IDEA (or any of your favorite editor).

Then, modify the fortuneteller project and the client project. We need to add the module-info.java file.

When run the Client's main should print a fortune provided by the Fortuneteller. Also, the 
client will verify the module names are provided as expected.
