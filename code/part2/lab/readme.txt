In this lab we will use jlink to create a targeted java executable named fortuneapp. Please use the two jar files given in this directory for that purpose.

Once you create the java executable, please run on your own java 

java --list-modules

to see the list of modules and compare that to the --list-modules output of the Java that is part 
of the JRE installation.

Also, execute your own java to make sure the client produces the desired output.
After that run the targeted java execute fortuneapp.

The two jar files given here are from the solutions to part 1 lab.

Please refer to the example in the part2/examples directory for steps to use jlink.
